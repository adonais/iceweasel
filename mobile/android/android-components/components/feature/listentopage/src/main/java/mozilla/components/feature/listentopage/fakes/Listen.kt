 * A fake implementation of [SpeechSynthesizer] for use in tests and Compose previews.
 *
 * It never touches the speech engine, and by default it never writes a file either: it names one and records what it
 * was asked to say.
 *
 * @property maxInputLength The limit to report. Set it low to exercise a caller's chunking.
 * @property voices The voices to offer for every language tag. Set it empty to exercise a caller's no-voice handling.
 * @property audioDirectory Where to write the audio, or `null` to name a file without creating one.
 * @property audioDuration How long the audio it writes lasts. Ignored without an [audioDirectory].
 * @property timePerRequest How long a request takes. Set it to make synthesis slow enough for a caller to be seen
 *   falling behind what is playing, which is otherwise instantaneous and so never behind.
 * @property failAtRequest The request to fail, counting from one, or `null` to fail none. A caller's handling of a
 *   chunk failing part way through an article cannot be exercised by an engine that fails from the start, because the
 *   article never gets going.
 * @property failWith What to fail that request with.
 * @property requests The text of every request, in the order it arrived.
 * @property files Every file it wrote, in the order it wrote them, so a test can name the ones a session left behind.
 * @property voiceRequests The language tag of every voice lookup, in the order it arrived.
 * @property closed Whether [close] has been called.
 * @property enginePackageName The engine to report
 * @property voicesSet Every voice the engine was told to read with, in order.
