        Each posted entry is {name, values}, where values is the raw list of
        per-query times in order. values[0] is reported as a -cold subtest and
        the rest as -hot, so the first query for each case is tracked separately
        from its steady state instead of being collapsed into one median.

        The benchmark also posts a first-query entry (a single value, main thread
        only) capturing the one-time, process-wide init that the very first query
        in a fresh process pays, so that cost is not charged to whichever codec
        runs first.
