  Handle a Perfherder performance regression bug end to end: read the alert bug, confirm
  whether the regression is real, find the cause, and iterate to a fix. Use when the user
  has a Perfherder/browsertime regression bug (the "N% <test> ... regression on <date>"
  bugs filed in Testing::Performance), needs to establish whether an alert summary is a
  real regression, is interpreting a PerfCompare baseRev/newRev comparison, or asks what
  to do about a patch of theirs that regressed a benchmark.
  Not for simply running perf tests or pushing them to try — including running an alert
  summary's tests with `mach try perf --alert` (use perftest) — nor for choosing or
  writing perf tests (use perftest), analyzing a profile you already have in hand
  (use profiler-analysis), SpiderMonkey microbenchmarks (use js-perf-investigation), or
  non-performance regressions such as failing tests, crashes, or build bustage.

# Triaging a Perfherder regression bug

## Tooling

Three tools cover the three kinds of evidence in a regression bug. Use them rather than
fetching URLs by hand — `WebFetch` on a Treeherder or profiler URL returns a UI shell with
no data in it.

- **The regression bug** — `mcp__moz__get_bugzilla_bug`, or the `@moz:bugzilla://bug/{id}`
  resource. There is no Bugzilla CLI; this is the supported path.
- **Push and job data** — `treeherder-cli <rev>`. Use `--perf` for performance and resource
  data, `--repo autoland` to inspect the culprit push, and `--watch --notify` to wait on a
  running try push instead of polling it.
- **Before/After profiles** — `profiler-cli`, driven through the **profiler-analysis**
  skill. If it is not installed: `npm install -g @firefox-devtools/profiler-cli@latest`.

`profiler-analysis` owns the profiler-cli protocol (run `profiler-cli guide` first, stop
the daemon when done). Hand profiles to that skill instead of reimplementing it here.

The regression policy gives the patch author **3 business days** to acknowledge and start
investigating before the patch may be backed out. Establish early whether that clock is
running, and tell the user if it is close to expiring.

## Step 1: read the bug

Fetch it with `@moz:bugzilla://bug/{id}`. Every Perfherder alert bug carries the same
machine-readable payload. Pull out all of it before doing anything else:

- **Alert summary ID** — the `perfherder/alerts?id=NNNNN` link. Feeds `--alert` in step 2.
- **Culprit push revision** — the `pushloghtml?changeset=...` link in comment 0.
- **Base / new revisions** — `baseRev=` and `newRev=` in the PerfCompare link.
- **Regressed tests** — first column of the alert table.
- **Platform and options** — e.g. `linux2404-64-shippable`, `fission webrender`.
- **Before/After profiles** — the profiler.firefox.com links in the last column.

The culprit push usually contains several patches. Inspect it directly rather than reading
the pushlog HTML:

```
treeherder-cli <culprit-rev> --repo autoland --perf
```

Identify which patch is the user's and which files it touched (`git show <rev>` / the
linked Phabricator revision). If the push has multiple candidate patches and it is not
obvious which is responsible, say so — the confirmation push below tests the user's patch
specifically, which is what settles it.

Summarize for the user: how big the regression is, which tests, which platform, and what
the patch changed. Then move to confirmation.

## Step 2: confirm it

Do this before any investigation. A meaningful fraction of alerts do not reproduce.

The whole confirmation is **one command**, not two manual pushes. `--alert` runs exactly
the tests in the alert summary and compares your working revision against the base revision
your patch sits on, pushing both sides for you:

```
./mach try perf --alert <ALERT_ID> --rebuild 10
```

Read `references/confirm.md` before running it — it covers getting the local repo onto the
right base revision, how many retriggers are actually needed, the pgo/shippable trap, and
how to read the result.

**Never push to try without explicit approval from the user.** Show the exact command, say
roughly what it will cost in CI, and wait.

Then branch on the outcome:

- **Reproduces** — continue to step 3.
- **Does not reproduce** — do not start optimizing. Go to `references/close-out.md`; this
  is likely noise or an unrelated patch in the same push.
- **Ambiguous / overlapping distributions** — more retriggers, or narrow to the single
  most-regressed test. See `references/confirm.md`.

## Step 3: find the cause

Start with the Before/After profiles already linked in the bug — they are free and
specific to the regressed test. Hand them to the **profiler-analysis** skill rather than
fetching them yourself; `WebFetch` on a profiler URL only retrieves the UI shell.

Compare against what the patch actually changed. Most Perfherder regressions on
speedometer-class benchmarks come from work added to a hot path, a lost fast path, extra
allocation, or added main-thread sync work.

## Step 4: iterate to a fix

Read `references/iterate.md`. The loop is change → narrow try push → check, and the entire
point of that file is keeping each round cheap: narrow the test set, drop to one platform,
and only re-run the full alert set for the final confirmation.

## Step 5: close out

Read `references/close-out.md` for the possible resolutions, the bug fields to set, and
who to talk to when the right answer is "this regression is acceptable."

## Cost discipline

This skill exists partly to keep regression work cheap, in CI and in tokens.

- One push per question. `--alert` gives base and new together; do not push twice.
- Confirm broadly once, then iterate narrowly. Full alert-set reruns are for the final
  check only.
- Do not read the reference files up front. Read the one for the step you are on.
- Read profiles through profiler-analysis, not by downloading them into context.
