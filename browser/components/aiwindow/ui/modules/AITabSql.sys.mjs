// Every time the schema or the underlying data changes, you must bump up the
// schema version.

// Remember to:
// 1. Bump up the version number
// 2. Add a migration function to migrate the data to the new schema.
// 3. Update #createDatabaseEntities and #checkDatabaseHealth
// 4. Add a test to check that the migration works correctly.

// Note: migrations should be reasonably re-entry-friendly. If the user
// downgrades, the schema version is decreased, and upon a subsequent upgrade,
// the migration step is reapplied.
// This ensures that any necessary conversions are performed, even for entries
// added after the downgrade.
// In practice, schema changes should be additive, allowing newer versions to
// operate on older schemas, albeit with potentially reduced functionality.
