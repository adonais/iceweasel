# Building Firefox on Windows using WSL

These steps were verified to work as of June 2024.

1. Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows by running Windows Powershell as Administrator and typing:

   ```
   wsl --install
   ```

2. Reboot Windows

3. Upon reboot, you should be asked to set up a user and password for Linux. If not, open Ubuntu from the Start menu.

4. Follow the {ref}`building-firefox-on-linux` instructions.

   :::{note}
   For Mercurial to work, you will need to follow the instructions for bash and restart WSL.
