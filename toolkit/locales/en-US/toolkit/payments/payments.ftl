# This value isn't used directly, but is defined to avoid duplication
# in the "credit-card-label-*" strings.
#
# Variables:
#   $month (String): Numeric month the credit card expires
#   $year (String): Four-digit year the credit card expires
credit-card-expiration = Expires on { $month }/{ $year }

## These labels serve as a description of a credit card.
## The description must include a credit card number, and may optionally
## include a cardholder name, an expiration date, or both, so we have
## four variations.

# Label for a credit card with a number only
#
# Variables:
#   $number (String): Partially-redacted credit card number
#   $type (String): Credit card type
credit-card-label-number-2 = { $number }
    .aria-label = { $type } { credit-card-label-number-2 }

# Label for a credit card with a number and name
#
# Variables:
#   $number (String): Partially-redacted credit card number
#   $name (String): Cardholder name
#   $type (String): Credit card type
credit-card-label-number-name-2 = { $number }, { $name }
    .aria-label = { $type } { credit-card-label-number-name-2 }

# Label for a credit card with a number and expiration date
#
# Variables:
#   $number (String): Partially-redacted credit card number
#   $type (String): Credit card type
credit-card-label-number-expiration-2 = { $number }, { credit-card-expiration }
    .aria-label = { $type } { credit-card-label-number-expiration-2 }

# Label for a credit card with a number, name, and expiration date
#
# Variables:
#   $number (String): Partially-redacted credit card number
#   $name (String): Cardholder name
#   $type (String): Credit card type
credit-card-label-number-name-expiration-2 =
  { $number }, { $name }, { credit-card-expiration }
    .aria-label = { $type } { credit-card-label-number-name-expiration-2 }

# Wraps one of the credit-card-label-* strings above to note that a security
# code is saved alongside the card. Only the presence of a saved security code
# is ever shown, never the code itself.
#
# "CVV" is a common abbreviation for the security code printed on a payment
# card. Use whichever abbreviation is most familiar in your locale.
#
# The visible label separates the two with a vertical bar, while the
# accessibility label uses a comma so that it is read as part of the same
# sentence as the rest of the card description.
#
# Variables:
#   $label (String): One of the credit-card-label-* values above
#   $ariaLabel (String): The .aria-label of that same credit-card-label-*
#     string, which additionally names the card type
credit-card-label-with-security-code = { $label } | CVV saved
    .aria-label = { $ariaLabel }, CVV saved
