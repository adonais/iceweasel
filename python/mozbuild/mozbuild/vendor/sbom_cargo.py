"""Map Cargo.lock onto SBOM records (see sbom.py for the record shape).

The Rust dependencies are the one part of the tree that already knows its own
dependency graph, its exact versions and, for registry crates, a checksum of
the published artifact. moz.yaml knows none of that: `third_party/rust` is
vendored wholesale, so without this the crates appear only as whatever
about:license attributes to them.

Like sbom.py this module does not import cyclonedx, so the mapping rules can be
unit tested from sites that do not vendor it.
